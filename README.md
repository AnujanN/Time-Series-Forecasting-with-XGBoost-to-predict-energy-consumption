# Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost

This project demonstrates how to use Python and XGBoost for time series forecasting to predict energy consumption.

## Files
- `predict.ipynb`: Main notebook for forecasting using PJME_hourly.csv
- `energy_forecasting.ipynb`: Synthetic data and full workflow example
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Excludes model outputs and large files from Git

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. (Optional) Save models and predictions for future use

## Note
- The `models/`, `predictions/`, and `energy_forecasting.ipynb` files are ignored in version control.
- For real-world use, replace synthetic data with your own energy consumption dataset.
